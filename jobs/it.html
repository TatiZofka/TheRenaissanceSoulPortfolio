            I am currently developing my React skills within
            <span class="blue">SheCodes React workshop</span>. SheCodes is a
            great women-oriented company, in which I have started my

            with its <span class="blue">pure logic and beauty</span>. React
            workshop is the last one from scale they offer and I am super
            excited to complete my

            The webpage you are currently looking at is part of my bigger
            project of <span class="blue">personal portfolio</span>. IT field is

            This project I coded using

            Building something that has real value was mersmerizing point in my
            coding journey. Although <span class="blue">Weather App</span> is
            something of what million other alteranatives exist, it is also
            something <span class="blue">people are using every day</span>.
            Understadning its <span class="blue">logic behind</span> was for me
            like unravelling magic spell you knew it exist somewhere, but untill

            When I look back at my very first
            <span class="blue">webpage I have coded year ago</span>, It makes me
            proud how far I have come. It is not the prettiest, most complicated
            or even functional, but it is my
            <span class="blue">humble begining</span>. I started coding with
            <span class="blue">SheCodes workshops</span> and follow their
            courses since then.

            This webpage is the result of many excercises I have tried in
            <span class="blue">CodeSandBox</span>, it is using
            <span class="blue">very basic HTML + CSS</span> and if you allow the
            pop-up on your web browser, it even includes
            <span class="blue">link for another real page</span> and app.

            <span class="blue">Johnson Controls International</span> was the
            first company I've worked in relatable
            <span class="blue">IT field position</span> for over a year. I have
            been part of Global IT Asset Management Team and specialized in
            <span class="blue">Hardware Asset Management</span>, occasionaly
            supporting Software Asset Management colleagues. Thanks to my
            language skills I have been able to support and manage
            <span class="blue">LATAM region</span>, where I've lead the
            <span class="blue">Wave Initiative</span> for savings.

            Although our team closely cooperated with local ITs, most of my
            daily job was still focused on
            <span class="blue">reporting and analysis process</span>, which was
            not enough for me. Therefore I decided to dive deeper into the IT
