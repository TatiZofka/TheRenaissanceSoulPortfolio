            I am currently developing my React skills within
            <span class="blue">SheCodes React workshop</span>. SheCodes is a
            great company, in which I have started my
            <span class="blue">coding journey</span> and instantly fell in love
            with its <span class="blue">pure logic and beauty</span>. React
            workshop is the last one from scale they offer and I am super
            excited to complete my
            <span class="blue">collection of certificates</span>. My estimated
            finish line for this project is October 2022.

            The webpage you are currently looking at is part of my bigger
            project of <span class="blue">personal portfolio</span>. IT field is
            just one small piece of <span class="blue">my career journey</span>,

            enough to digg deep into the top od this

            This project I coded using
            <span class="blue">HTML + CSS and is fully responsive</span>, in
            order to users of <span class="blue">mobile devices</span> have the
