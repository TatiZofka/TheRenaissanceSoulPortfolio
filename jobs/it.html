            I am currently developing my React skills within the
            <span class="blue">SheCodes React workshop</span>. SheCodes is a
            great women-oriented company, in which I started my
            <span class="blue">coding journey</span> and instantly fell in love
            with its <span class="blue">pure logic and beauty</span>. React
            workshop is the last one from the scale they offer and I am super
            excited to complete my
            <span class="blue">collection of certificates</span>. My estimated
            finish line for this project is
            <span class="blue">October 2022</span>.

            my <span class="blue">Renaissance Soul</span> CV. If you are brave

            This project I coded using

            Building something that has real value was a mesmerizing point in my
            coding journey. Although <span class="blue">Weather App</span> is
            something of what million other alternatives exist, it is also
            something <span class="blue">people are using every day</span>.
            Understanding its
            <span class="blue">behind the scenes logic</span> was for me like
            unraveling a magic spell you knew to exist somewhere, but until now
            you haven't been part of.

            This project I coded using

            unique icons from <span class="blue">Font Awesome</span>, plus it is

            When I look back at the very first
            <span class="blue">webpage I coded a year ago</span>, It makes me
            proud of how far I have come. It is not the prettiest, most
            complicated, or even functional, but it is my
            <span class="blue">humble beginning</span>. I started coding with
            <span class="blue">SheCodes workshops</span> and follow their
            courses since then.

            This webpage is the result of many exercises I have tried in
            <span class="blue">CodeSandBox</span>, it is using
            <span class="blue">very basic HTML + CSS</span> and if you allow the
            pop-up on your web browser, it even includes
            <span class="blue">links for another real page</span> and app.

            <span class="blue">Johnson Controls International</span> was the
            first company I've worked in a relatable
            <span class="blue">IT field position</span> for over a year. I have
            been part of the Global IT Asset Management Team and specialized in
            <span class="blue">Hardware Asset Management</span>, occasionally
            supporting Software Asset Management colleagues. Thanks to my
            language skills I have been able to support and manage the
            <span class="blue">LATAM region</span>, where I've led the
            <span class="blue">Wave Initiative</span> for savings.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although our team closely cooperated with local ITs, most of my
            daily job was still focused on
            <span class="blue">reporting and analysis process</span>, which was
            not enough for me. Therefore I decided to dive deeper into the IT
            world and started my <span class="blue">coding journey</span>.
